# Heart rate monitoring based on thermal vision images

This was a project that I did in the [Analysis of Biomedical Images]() class in final year of undergraduate studies in the summer of 2021.

The goal was to extract the ROIs (in this case surface blood clots, primarily carotide( from thermal vision images using image processing techniques and to calculate subject's heart rate based on the intensity changes in extraced ROIs.
The detailed description of the process is, for now, available in Serbian as a .pdf document (in the form of a project report).
